## üåü Introduction

This Patent Policy ("Policy") outlines the terms under which contributors to the TextIt project grant patent rights to users and other contributors. This Policy is an integral part of the TextIt project's intellectual property framework and works in conjunction with the project's [LICENSE](LICENSE) and other governance documents.

## üìñ Definitions

- **"Contributor"** means any individual or entity that contributes code or other content to the TextIt project.
- **"User"** means any individual or entity that uses, modifies, or distributes the TextIt software.
- **"Work"** refers to the TextIt software and any contributions made to it.
- **"Patent Claims"** means any patent claim(s), now owned or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, having made, or importing the Work.
- **"Lawsuit"** means any lawsuit, proceeding, or other legal action related to patent infringement.

## üìú Patent Grant

### 3.1 Grant of Rights

Each Contributor to the TextIt project hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

### 3.2 Scope of Grant

This patent license applies to:
- All past, present, and future versions of the TextIt software
- Any derivative works created by You that are based on or incorporate the Work
- Any combination of the Work with other software or hardware

### 3.3 Sublicensing

This patent grant includes the right to sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple tiers of sublicensees, provided that such sublicensing is consistent with the terms of the MIT License.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Patent Defense

### 4.1 Termination for Patent Litigation

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this Policy for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 4.2 Defensive Suspension

If You assert a patent infringement claim against TextIt or any Contributor, the patent licenses granted to You under this Policy will terminate automatically.

### 4.3 Reinstatement

If You cease all violation of this Policy, then Your license from a particular Contributor is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the violation by some reasonable means within 60 days of having been notified by You of the violation.

## üîÑ Compatibility with Other Licenses

### 5.1 MIT License Compatibility

This patent grant is designed to be compatible with the MIT License used by TextIt. In case of any conflict between this patent grant and the MIT License, the terms of the MIT License shall prevail.
