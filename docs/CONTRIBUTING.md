### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for TextIt. Following these guidelines helps maintainers understand your report, reproduce the issue, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [documentation](README.md)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Perform a [search](https://github.com/yourusername/textit/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/yourusername/textit/issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a CPU profile capture with your report.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.
* **Specify the version of TextIt you're using (1.5.0)**
* **Specify your Java version (Java 8)**
* **Specify your PostgreSQL version if relevant**

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain TextIt's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible TextIt
- Enable a sustainable system for TextIt's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing
4. Ensure your code follows our security guidelines:
   - No hardcoded credentials
   - Proper input validation
   - Secure database operations
   - Thread-safe operations
5. Include appropriate test cases for new features

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

### Current Development Focus

As TextIt is in early development, we are particularly interested in contributions in these areas:

* Improving the authentication system (completing login functionality)
* Enhancing security features (better password hashing, secure encryption)
* Developing the social features (follow system, like system)
* Optimizing database operations
* Adding comprehensive error handling
* Implementing proper logging instead of System.out.println
* Adding unit and integration tests

Please refer to our [task list](tasks.md) for specific items that need attention.
