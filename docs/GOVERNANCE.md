# TextIt Project Governance

*Last updated: July 14, 2025*

## Overview

This document describes the governance model for the TextIt project. It outlines how decisions are made, how contributors can become maintainers, and the overall structure of the project leadership.

## Project Roles

### Users

Users are community members who use TextIt. They are the most important members of the community as they provide the purpose for the project. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute to the project in various ways, such as:

- Code contributions
- Documentation
- Design
- Translation
- Issue triage
- Answering questions in forums or chat
- Organizing events
- Security reviews
- Performance optimization
- Database optimization
- Security testing

Anyone can become a contributor by submitting a pull request, helping with documentation, or participating in discussions.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are contributors who have shown dedication to the project and have been given the rights to merge code into the repository. They are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging issues
- Guiding the technical direction of their components
- Ensuring the quality of the codebase
- Maintaining security standards
- Ensuring thread safety
- Optimizing database operations
- Implementing security features

#### Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who have made significant and valuable contributions to the project may be invited to become maintainers. The process is:

1. A contributor is nominated by an existing maintainer
2. The nomination is discussed by the existing maintainers
3. The nomination is approved if there is consensus among the maintainers
4. The new maintainer undergoes a security training program

### Core Team

The Core Team consists of maintainers who have demonstrated long-term commitment to the project and have taken on additional responsibilities for the overall health and direction of the project. The Core Team:

- Sets the overall technical direction of the project
- Maintains security standards and practices
- Oversees performance optimization
- Ensures database integrity
- Manages security vulnerabilities
- Makes decisions when maintainer consensus cannot be reached
- Manages the TextIt brand
- Manages project resources
- Resolves conflicts within the community

## Decision Making

### Consensus-Based Approach

TextIt follows a consensus-based approach to decision-making. For most decisions, we seek input from all stakeholders and try to find a solution that addresses everyone's concerns.

### Lazy Consensus

For day-to-day decisions, we follow a "lazy consensus" model. A proposal is considered accepted if:

1. It was properly communicated to the relevant stakeholders
2. No one objects within a reasonable timeframe (usually one week for minor changes, two weeks for significant changes)

### Voting

When consensus cannot be reached, the Core Team may call for a vote. Voting is done using the following system:

- +1: Approve
- 0: Neutral
- -1: Disapprove (must include reasoning)

A proposal passes if:
- It receives more +1 votes than -1 votes
- At least 50% of Core Team members have voted
- No Core Team member has vetoed the proposal (a -1 vote with a compelling reason)

## Communication

The project uses the following primary communication channels:

- GitHub issues and pull requests for code-related discussions
- Mailing lists for broader discussions
- Chat platforms for real-time communication
- Regular video meetings for synchronous discussions

All project decisions must be documented and publicly accessible.

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the TextIt community are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The Core Team is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct.

## Changes to Governance

Changes to this governance document require approval from the Core Team. Proposed changes should be submitted as pull requests and will be subject to the decision-making process outlined above.

## Project Resources

The following resources are managed by the Core Team:

- GitHub organization and repositories
- Domain names and websites
- Social media accounts
- Financial resources and sponsorships
- Trademarks and other intellectual property

## Conflict Resolution

In case of conflicts between community members:

1. The involved parties should attempt to resolve the conflict directly
2. If that fails, they can request mediation from a maintainer
3. If mediation is unsuccessful, the issue can be escalated to the Core Team
4. The Core Team's decision is final

## Acknowledgment

This governance model is inspired by successful open-source projects and is designed to evolve as the TextIt project grows.
